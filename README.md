# go-2048

## Overview

This project is @NickSavage's Go implementation of the popular 2048 game using the [Ebitengine 2D game library](https://ebitengine.org/). It's a simple yet addictive puzzle game where the player combines numbered tiles to reach the elusive 2048 tile. While there are many 2048 implementations, this was intended as a basic introduction for myself into [Ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/)

- Go programming language
- Ebitengine
- Custom tile rendering and game logic
